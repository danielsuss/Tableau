## What it does

Tableau helps you organize your campaigns and present them beautifully to your players. Create chapters, manage your assets, set up combat encounters, and present everything on a second monitor while keeping your DM tools on your main screen.

## Key Features

- **Chapter-based Organization** - Keep your campaigns organized with a simple chapter system
- **Asset Management** - Store and organize landscapes, character art, and battlemaps in one place
- **Combat Scenarios** - Set up tactical encounters with hexagonal grids and entity positioning
- **Entity Management** - Track hitpoints, allegiance, positioning, and visibility for all creatures
- **Dual-Monitor Presentation** - Separate display windows for presenting to players while keeping your controls private
- **Real-time Sync** - Changes in your constructor windows instantly appear on the display screens
- **Cross-Window Communication** - Seamlessly switch between campaign view and combat mode

## How it works

**Setup Phase:**
1. Create a new chapter for your session or campaign
2. Upload landscape images for exploration scenes
3. Add character splash art for NPCs and story moments
4. Import battlemaps and set up combat scenarios with hex grids
5. Add entities (monsters, NPCs, players) with their stats and positioning

**Game Time:**
1. Open a display window on your second monitor (or projector)
2. Use your constructor interface to control what players see
3. Switch between landscapes, character art, and combat maps in real-time
4. Manage entity positioning, health, and visibility during encounters
5. Everything syncs automatically - your players see exactly what you want them to see

## Perfect for

- Dungeon Masters running in-person sessions with projectors or TV screens
- Online DMs using virtual tabletops who want better asset organization
- Anyone who wants to separate their DM interface from what players see
- Groups that enjoy tactical combat with hex-based positioning

Built with React, TypeScript, and Rust using the Tauri framework.
